# Moonwater Gully
Farming game created in C++ using SFML with two friends.

The aim of the game is to make as much money (called shells) as possible by expanding and growing your farm!

This can be achieved by buying plant seeds and harvest equipment, planting seeds, watering crops, havesting plants, and selling produce!

You can also save the game at any time, and when you play again you are given the option to load previously saved game or start over (using spacebar and enter keys to choose).
